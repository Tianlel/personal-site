I got my free sound tracks for the bounces from Epidemic Sound.\n      </p>\n      <p>By clicking on different colored boxes from above you can pick from\n        different cute animals + 1 planet with different percussion sounds and\n        place them in different places so that they can bounce off the ground and\n        make beats. The three round buttons on the left allow you to adjust the\n        bouncing speed and reset the stage.Â  The lower line of cubes are like piano\n        keys, you can press on them to play notes and add more tune to your music.\n      </p>\n      <p>Video demos:\n        <li>VR mode with inelastic bouncing: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zTAnOJtwpSf4uvrthNClY3Jk-kJEAiyc/view?usp=sharing\">link</a></li>\n        <li>AR mode with inelastic bouncing: <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TClC4Iu046uaJIDkZLzpkbn_cCH6LhFT/view?usp=sharing\">link</a></li>\n      </p>\n      <p>I created this project with <a href=\"http://openendedgroup.com/field/\">Field</a>.</p>\n    </article>\n  </Main>\n);\n\nexport default Qupcakes;\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
